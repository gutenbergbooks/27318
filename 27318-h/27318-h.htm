<h2><a name="NOTE" id="NOTE"></a>NOTE</h2>

<div class='just'>
	<p>Mr. L. L. Harr's skill in the game of Pung Chow has been acquired
	through more than twenty years of intimate contact with the business and
	official circles of cultured Chinese in Canton, Shanghai, Tientsin,
	Pekin and other centers of China. Mr. Harr has enjoyed more opportunity
	to mingle in polite Chinese society than any other European or American
	resident I knew in China.</p>

	<p>Mr. Harr, in consequence, was perhaps one of the first foreigners who
	learned the game from the best players in China. What is more, Mr.
	Harr's unusually keen appreciation and enthusiasm were largely
	instrumental in arousing the popularity of this extraordinarily
	fascinating Chinese game in the Western Hemisphere. To use a familiar
	American phrase, Mr. Harr was unquestionably one of the pioneers who put
	"PUNG CHOW" on the map west of Suez.</p>

	<p>Mr. Harr has not only brought the game to America, but has written the
	first authoritative book on "Pung Chow," based on the best modern
	methods of Chinese play.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<div class='just'> <!-- this tag justifies text as default from here on!-->

	<p >Out of China has come this stately game with the lure of Oriental
	mysticism to whet jaded appetites and with possibilities for study that
	challenge the keenest intelligence.</p>

	<p >There is a mysticism about the Oriental and his mode of life that
	challenges the imagination and induces a curiosity hard to decipher. The
	dress of the Chinese, their strange customs, their difficult language,
	and their apparently impenetrable mask-like faces appeal to the fancy
	and throw a veil of mystery around even the commonplace.</p>

	<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

	<p >The origin of this game is lost in the mist of centuries past. There is,
	though, an oral tradition to the effect that it was originated in the
	Court of the King of Wu, now known as Ning-Po, during the year of 472
	B.C. to entertain his consort and her court ladies and to help them
	while away the time which lay heavily on their hands. This was about the
	time of Confucius. It is, however, known to have been the Royal game,
	restricted to the use of Emperors and their friends of the Mandarin
	class for two thousand years. To them it was known as Pe-Ling
	(pronounced Bah-Ling) taking its name from the "bird of a hundred
	intelligences," the lark-like creature sacred in the Chinese faith which
	now may be seen reproduced on most Chinese tapestries and embroideries.
	The penalty paid by one of any other class for playing Pe-Ling at that
	time, was the loss of his head. Later&mdash;no one knows just when&mdash;the
	privilege of playing this wonder game was extended to the merchant or
	middle classes&mdash;and when, some 70 years ago&mdash;a social uprising
	threatened, one of the concessions granted to calm the unrest was the
	universal privilege of playing this game. In this way was caused the
	confusion of names for the game which exists even to-day in China; for,
	with the abolishing of Pe-Ling, each province applied their own name and
	pronunciation to the game, with the result that now we have from twelve
	to eighteen different names, by which the game is known. A few of these
	are Ma-Cheuk, Mah-Jong, Mah-Juck, Mah-Diao and Mah-Jongg.</p>

	<p >Pung Chow is made to withstand the climatic conditions which soon
	destroy the article imported under the name of Mah-Jongg and the other
	corruptions of Mah-Diao, and it is the true and original Chinese game
	translated by the addition of numerals just enough to be readily
	understood and not enough to spoil the artistry of the tiles. The
	addition of numerals has been overdone in the marking of many of the
	cheaper imported sets, and give the appearance of having had numerals
	sprinkled on them regardless of where they may land and permitted to
	stay.</p>

	<p>The fundamentals of this game are simple and require only practice to
	master. The science of Pung Chow must in the greater part be studied out
	by the individual player and one may spend the rest of his life in
	attaining to past mastery in its thousand-fold intricacies.</p>

	<h2><a name="SUMMARY_OF_THE_GAME" id="SUMMARY_OF_THE_GAME"></a>SUMMARY OF THE GAME</h2>


	<p>Before going thoroughly into the details of the playing of the game, it
	is better to give a general view of the play and its object.</p>

	<p>Pung Chow is played by thoroughly shuffling all of the tiles face down
	in the middle of the table, and forming them in a double-tiered, hollow
	square, called the wall. This wall is then broken at some point
	determined by the dice and each player draws an original hand of 13
	tiles. This leaves about two-thirds of the wall intact, and the rest of
	the play is devoted to drawing and discarding from this remainder of the
	wall; each player improving and matching his own individual hand until
	having arranged it into four sets and a pair, some player wins. A set is
	three of a kind, four of a kind or three in a sequence. Every set has a
	scoring value, and the players add their scores and settle after every
	hand. A player may win with a score as low as 22 points or scores may
	run to 380,928 points. These possibilities will unfold as the following
	pages on the details of the play are read.</p>

	<h2><a name="DESCRIPTION_OF_TILES" id="DESCRIPTION_OF_TILES"></a>DESCRIPTION OF TILES</h2>

	<p>The game is played with 136 tiles, which are divided into four distinct
	and separate suits. These four suits are called the <i>Bamboo</i>, <i>Dot</i>,
	<i>Character</i> and <i>Honor Suits</i>.</p>

	<p>The first three of these suits score equally and are arranged in the
	same manner, that is, there are 36 tiles in each, numbering from one to
	nine, and there are four tiles of each numeral.</p>

	<p>The fourth suit, known as the honor suit, is divided into three parts:
	the <i>Dragons</i>, the <i>Winds</i> and the <i>Mandarins</i>. Of the <i>Dragons</i>, there
	are four apiece of three different kinds, the Red, Green and White
	Dragons. The <i>Winds</i> are North, South, East and West with four tiles
	alike for each. The <i>Mandarins</i> (also called <i>Seasons</i>, and <i>Flowers</i>),
	are 8 in number, and as they are only used in limit hands, will be
	discussed later.</p>

	<p>From Illustration No. 2 a player will see that there are four of every
	different tile in the set, and that there are 34 different tiles.</p>

	<h2><a name="PROCEDURE_OF_PLAY" id="PROCEDURE_OF_PLAY"></a>PROCEDURE OF PLAY</h2>

	<h3 class='smcap' style="text-align: left;">A. East Wind.</h3>

	<p>Position of the players for the first game is determined by a throw of
	the dice; all players throw once, the one throwing the highest number
	becoming first <i>East Wind</i>. In the event of a tie, players tieing throw
	again. The player sitting opposite <i>East Wind</i> will be known as <i>West
	Wind</i>, to the right of <i>East Wind</i> as <i>South Wind</i>, and <ins class = "mycorr"
	title = "original has 'the the'"><a name="corr1" id="corr1">the</a></ins> left of
	<i>East Wind</i>, as <i>North Wind</i>. The dice need only be thrown to determine
	<i>East Wind</i> for the first game of an evening's play, for if the player
	representing <i>East Wind</i> wins, or if the game is a draw, he remains
	<i>East Wind</i>. If he loses, the player to his right becomes <i>East Wind</i>,
	he in turn becoming <i>North Wind</i>.</p>

	<p><i>East Wind</i> is sometimes called <i>Banker</i>, for he must pay double stakes
	when he loses, and wins double stakes when he wins.</p>

	<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p><h3 class='smcap left'>B. Building and Breaking the Wall.</h3>

	<p>Before building the wall the tiles must all be turned face down on the
	table and thoroughly shuffled. Then each player proceeds to build one
	side of the wall by taking 34 of the tiles at random, and arranging them
	side by side in a row 17 tiles long and 2 tiers high.</p>

	<div class='figcenter'><img src="images/illustration_4.jpg"  alt="Illustration No. 4."></img>
		<br />
		<br />
		<span class='caption'>Illustration No. 4.</span>
	</div>

	<p>Each player then moves his side of the wall forward, the four sides
	forming a hollow square. This represents a Chinese wall or fort common
	in the protection of cities.</p>

	<div class='figcenter'><img src="images/illustration_5.jpg"  alt="Illustration No. 5."></img>
		<br />
		<br />
		<span class='caption'>Illustration No. 5.</span>
	</div>

	<p>To find the point at which the wall is to be broken, <i>East Wind</i> always
	throws the dice. The number thrown will indicate the player who is to
	break the wall. The player is found by <i>East Wind</i> counting around the
	table to the right, starting with himself as "one," until he reaches the
	number thrown which will designate the player to break the wall.</p>

	<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

	<div class='figcenter'><img src="images/illustration_6.jpg"  alt="Illustration No. 6."></img>
		<br />
		<br />
		<span class='caption'>Illustration No. 6.</span>
	</div>

	<p>In this illustration, if <i>East Wind</i> threw a "7," starting with himself
	as one, <i>South</i> would be 2, <i>West</i> 3, <i>North</i> 4, <i>East</i> 5, <i>South</i> 6,
	and <i>West</i> 7, designating <i>West</i> as the player to break the wall.</p>

	<p>The player who has been designated to break the wall then throws the
	dice to determine the exact tile at which he shall break the wall,
	adding this throw to <i>East Wind</i>. This sum will indicate the tile at
	which the wall is to be broken, the player to break the wall counting
	the sum off from the right end of his own side, i.e., if 14 <a name="corr2" id="corr2">
	<ins class = "mycorr" title = "original has 'in'">is</ins></a> the sum
	of the two throws, the wall will be broken by lifting out the 14th tile
	from the right with the one under it and placing both on the top of the
	wall to the right of where it was broken. These two are called loose
	tiles and they mark the end of the wall.</p>

	<div class='figcenter'><img src="images/illustration_7.jpg"  alt="Illustration No. 7."></img>

		<div class='caption'>Illustration No. 7.
			<div class='just'>
				<i>East Wind</i> threw "7" indicating <i>West Wind</i> as the wall-breaker. <i>West Wind</i>
				then threw "7" designating the 14th tile from the right end of his side of the wall, as the exact
				spot where the wall was to be broken. The loose tiles are shown in correct position.
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>

	<h3 class='smcap left'>C. Drawing the Original Hand:</h3>

	<p>Each player then draws the 13 tiles which go to make up his original
	hand. <i>East Wind</i> starts the drawing by taking the first four tiles (2
	blocks of 2 each) at the beginning of the wall, the player on his right
	the next four and so on around the table three times which will give
	each player 12 tiles. Then one tile apiece is drawn in regular order
	giving every player 13 tiles, except <i>East Wind</i> who draws an extra tile
	as he must make the first discard.</p>

	<p>Each player then takes his original hand and arranges it to suit his own
	convenience. It is advised, however, that he arrange it in suits in
	order to see at a glance, the value of any one tile to his hand in the
	drawing and discarding of which the rest of the game consists.</p>

	<p>When the hands have been arranged, <i>East Wind</i> starts the play by
	discarding any tile in his hand, face up in the center of the table. It
	is because of this first discard that he drew an extra tile. The play
	then goes to the right, it becoming the turn of <i>South Wind</i> to draw the
	next tile in the wall and discard any one he may choose. <i>West Wind</i>
	then draws and discards and so on around the table, constantly in a
	counter-clockwise direction.</p>

	<p>The players during this drawing and discarding are gradually improving
	their hands, and matching them into four sets and an extra tile, a set
	being <i>three of a kind</i>, <i>four of a kind</i>, or <i>three in a sequence</i>.</p>

	</div>

	<p>When a player accomplishes this, he must only match the extra tile
	forming a <i>pair</i> and thus, completing his hand, having four complete
	sets and a pair. He announces "<i>Mah-Jongg</i>" wins, the game is over, the
	scores are settled and the wall built up for the next game.</p>

		<span class='caption'>Illustration No. 10.<br />Several completed hands</span>
	</div>

	<p>As completing a hand entirely by draw from the wall would be a
	difficult task, the players are permitted to make use of any discard,
	<i>as it is discarded</i>, provided they have the required tiles already in
	their hand as explained below in "<i>Chow</i>" and "<i>Pung</i>."</p>

	<h3 class='smcap left'>E. To Chow:</h3>

	<p>A player having two tiles in his hand which, together with the tile just
	discarded by the player before him (to his left), would form a sequence
	or run of three, may by announcing "<i>Chow</i>" pick up the discard, add it
	to the two in his hand, and place the three in sequence face up on the
	table to the right of his hand. This appropriating the discard serves as
	the player's draw and he must then discard and the play goes on in the
	usual manner.</p>

	<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

	<p>For example: If one has a 5-6 of <i>character</i> and the player preceding
	him discards either a 4 or a 7 of <i>character</i>, he may "<i>Chow</i>" the tile,
	and discard; or ignore it and draw from the wall and discard, in hopes
	of building a better hand, as often will be found advisable.</p>

	<p>The main point to be remembered in "<i>Chowing</i>" is that a player may
	"<i>Chow</i>" <i>only in his regular turn</i>, i.e., he may "<i>Chow</i>" only tiles
	discarded by the player to his left and then <i>only when he has the other
	two tiles in his hand</i> to form the sequence. Sequences can only be built
	up in sets of three.</p>

				In this illustration the player having a 4 and 6 of character in his hand has "<i>chowed</i>"
				the 5 character which the player to his left discarded and after setting out his
				sequence, discards himself, leaving the usual 13 tiles in his hand.
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>

	<h3 class='smcap left'>F. To Pung:</h3>

	<p>A player may also appropriate another player's discard to fill a set of
	three of a kind or four of a kind by announcing "<i>Pung</i>." In order to do
	this, the player must have <i>a pair</i>, or <i>three of a kind in his hand</i> to
	match with the discard, thus completing three or four of a kind, which
	he places, as in the case of a "<i>Chow</i>," to the right of his hand, face
	up on the table. For example: A player having a pair or three fives of
	the character suit, may <i>pung</i> when another player discards a five
	character, expose his set and discard, the play going on in the regular
	direction from him.</p>

	<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

	<p>It is not necessary for it to be the player's turn to draw in order to
	"<i>Pung</i>" as it is in the case of a "<i>Chow</i>." A player having a pair
	similar to a tile discarded, may announce "<i>Pung</i>" and appropriate the
	tile, <i>regardless of who discarded it and of whose turn it is to draw</i>.
	Also after a player "<i>Pungs</i>" and discards, the play goes on from him to
	the right. It can be seen that due to <i>punging</i> one or even two players
	are liable to lose their turn.</p>

			</div>
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>There are a few rules applying to the "<i>Chow</i>" and "<i>Pung</i>." They are as
	follows:</p>

	<p>1. All tiles must be "<i>punged</i>" or "<i>chowed</i>" <i>as they are discarded</i>;
	for a tile discarded by a player and allowed to remain in discard until
	the next player discards, becomes "dead" and <i>cannot be</i> touched during
	the rest of the game.</p>

	<p>2. It has been stated that one cannot "<i>pung</i>" unless it makes up three
	or four of a kind. This is true with one exception. In the case: when a
	tile will complete a player's hand allowing him to "<i>Mah-Jongg</i>," the
	tile may be punged. Example: A player with four sets and an odd tile may
	<i>pung</i> a tile which matches his odd one. The rule is that "<i>a player may
	at any time 'Pung' a discard which will complete his hand and allow him
	to Mah-Jongg</i>."</p>

	<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

	<p>3. The denomination and suit of each tile must be announced as it is
	discarded, a player discarding a 3 of <i>character</i>, announcing <i>3
	character</i>, to prevent confusion of a player who may be studying his
	hand. This is more of a courtesy of the game, than a rule.</p>

	<p>4. A "<i>Pung</i>" has precedence over a "<i>Chow</i>" and if one player can pung
	the same discard that another player can chow, the former has the right
	to appropriate the tile.</p>

	<p>5. If a player can pung a discard which will complete his <i>hand</i> and
	another player can pung the same discard to complete a <i>set</i>, the former
	has the right to take the discard.</p>

	<p>6. If two players pung the same tile to complete their hands, the
	precedence is given to the player claiming the tile nearest to the
	discarder in a counter-clockwise direction around the table.</p>



	<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

	<h2><a name="FOUR_OF_A_KIND" id="FOUR_OF_A_KIND"></a>FOUR OF A KIND:</h2>


	<p>Before speaking of "<i>four of a kind</i>," it is better to give the reason
	for exposing a set made up of a pair and a punged discard, and make
	clear at the same time, what is to be done when three of a kind are
	completed by draw.</p>

	<p>A set made up of a pair and a punged discard must be "exposed" by
	setting it out face up, on the table to the right of the players' tiles,
	first, to show to the other players that he had the required pair, which
	gave him the right to appropriate the discard, and secondly, to separate
	the set from those completed entirely by draw from the wall. Sets
	completed by help of an appropriated (punged) discard, have only
	one-half the scoring value of exactly the same sets, completed by draw
	from the wall and kept in the hand.</p>

	<p>Thus there are many advantages in drawing the third tile to complete a
	set of three of a kind when compared to "punging" the same, for in the
	former case, the set has twice as much scoring value, they are kept
	concealed in the hand and the opponents can only guess as to how nearly
	complete a concealed hand may be. A concealed set is counted as one of
	the four sets required to win, just as an exposed set would be, and a
	player having a set of three of a kind concealed has very good chances
	of filling it and thus forming four of a kind which counts a great deal
	higher.</p>

	<p>A player may complete a set of four of a kind either by draw from the
	wall or "punging" an opponent's discard, if he has three of a kind
	<i>already in his hand</i>. In <i>either</i> case he must place the completed set
	on the table to the right of his tiles; all four face up if he "punged"
	the fourth, the two end tiles face down if he has "drawn" the fourth.</p>

	<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>
	<p>The player must immediately draw a "<i>loose tile</i>" (one of the two tiles
	on top of, and marking the end of the wall). Usually the one farthest
	from the end is taken, the one on the end moved up, and replaced by a
	tile from the end of the wall itself.</p>

	<p>The "<i>loose tile</i>" was drawn because every time a player completes a
	set of four of a kind, he causes the rest of his hand to be one tile
	short. This must be made up every time four of a kind is filled by an
	extra tile drawn from the "<i>loose</i>" tiles.</p>

				In this illustration the player had three one dots in his hand and <i>drew</i> the fourth in his

	<div class='just'>In this illustration the player has
	one set of 3 one dots punged and completed, and is now trying to match
	up the rest of his hand. If another player discards a one dot he cannot
	touch it and must let it go by. However, if he draws the fourth one dot
	himself, he may add it on to his set of 3, draw a loose tile and discard
	as usual. As can be seen from the last three illustrations, the rule in
	the case of four of a kind is as follows:</div></div></div>

	<p><i>In any set which a player may have exposed on the table there must not
	be more than</i> (1) <i>punged tile</i>.</p>

	<p>A player having three of a kind in his hand may <i>pung</i> the fourth when
	it is discarded or having three of a kind on the table and drawing the
	fourth may add it to his 3 exposed tiles. The rule, however, bars him
	from appropriating some one else's discard to make a fourth for an
	exposed set of three of a kind because in order to appropriate this
	discard he would have to pung it. This he has not the privilege of
	doing, because he already must have one "<i>punged</i>" tile in his exposed
	set or it wouldn't be exposed.</p>



	<hr style="width: 65%;" />
	<h2><a name="MAH-JONGG_OR_MAH-DIAO" id="MAH-JONGG_OR_MAH-DIAO"></a>MAH-JONGG OR MAH-DIAO</h2>


	<p>As has been mentioned before when a player has matched his hand into
	four (4) sets and by a draw or a pung has mated the final pair he wins
	and announces "<i>Mah-Jongg</i>" or "<i>Mah-Diao</i>" (Dee-O), either being
	correct and in common usage, the latter being the most logical because
	of its English translation "mating the pair." A player must at all times
	during the game have thirteen (13) tiles, his draw every round
	momentarily giving him fourteen (14), his discard leaving him the
	thirteen (13). Then for every four of a kind that he fills he should
	have an extra tile in his hand on account of the extra loose tile draw.</p>

	<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
	<p>Thus one is able at any time during the game to check his hand and
	ascertain whether or not he has the correct number of tiles in it. If he
	has not sets of four of a kind he should have thirteen tiles in his
	hand. If he <i>has</i> one set of four of a kind he should have fourteen
	tiles in his hand, two sets of four of kind 15 tiles, and so on.</p>

	<p>If, at any time during the game, a player has an incorrect number of
	tiles in his hand, it becomes "dead." He must continue drawing and
	discarding, but when the scores are settled his score does not count and
	therefore he must pay all players. His only chance lies in endeavoring
	to prevent the other players from completing their hands, by holding the
	tiles which he believes they need and thus causing a draw game.</p>

	<hr style="width: 65%;" />
	<h2><a name="SETTLING_THE_SCORES" id="SETTLING_THE_SCORES"></a>SETTLING THE SCORES</h2>


	<p>When the first player to complete his hand calls "<i>Mah-Jongg</i>" the game
	is ended, and all players expose their hands and count up their scores.
	The winner of the game collects full value of his score from each of the
	other players and throwing his hand into the discard is thru for that
	game.</p>

	<p>The remaining three players then settle among themselves the
	<i>difference</i> of their scores, the high hand of the three collecting the
	difference between his score and each of the remaining two players. Then
	throwing his hand into the discard, leaves the remaining two to settle
	their scores, the highest hand of which collects the difference.</p>

	<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>
	<p>It must be remembered here that East Wind (or banker) pays or collects
	double, if he loses or wins.</p>

	<p>Scores are most conveniently settled by the use of the counters which
	are furnished with the sets. These are spotted to denote different
	denominations and at the end of every hand the actual scores or
	differences in scores are settled between players by the exchange of
	these counters. There are several styles of counter sets. The one in
	most common usage contains counters valued as follows:</p>

	<h2><a name="SUGGESTIONS_FOR_CAREFUL_PLAYING_OF_HANDS" id="SUGGESTIONS_FOR_CAREFUL_PLAYING_OF_HANDS"></a>SUGGESTIONS FOR CAREFUL PLAYING OF HANDS</h2>

	<p>In a game of this nature where every hand is different from the
	preceding one and so much depends on the draw, it is very hard to lay
	down any specific rules of how it should be played. There are, however,
	a few points which would help if kept in mind during the play. A player
	should study his original hand and after the first few draws and
	discards form a general plan of what he is going to try and fill in his
	hand and decide on how high a score he will have a good chance of
	making. This will be decided by:</p>

	<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

	<p>1. The condition of his own hand.</p>

	<p>2. The discards of the other three players.</p>

	<p>If he has an exceptionally strong hand in any one suit he will play for
	that suit regardless of the other players. If he has a well-divided
	hand, by watching the other players' discards, he will be able to form a
	fairly good opinion of what they are doing with their hand.</p>

	<p>After judging his hand, visualizing the sort of hand that he is to try
	to fill, he should use his own judgment in drawing and discarding,
	constantly watching his own hand for opportunities and his opponents'
	discards for disclosures, and upon the slightest suspicion that one of
	these opponents is nearing the completion of his hand, should
	immediately forego any thoughts of a higher hand himself and seek to
	complete his own hand as quickly as possible.</p>

	<p>Summing this up; a player should plan and play to win at all times with
	as high a hand as possible, then as the wall grows shorter and the
	probability of one of the opponents completing his hand grows larger,
	the player should reconsider, and</p>

	<p>1. If he has at that stage an exceptionally good hand which will win
	back for him from the other two players that which he loses to the
	winner, should go on improving his hand and take the chance of another
	player winning.</p>

	<p>2. If he has just an ordinarily good hand he should stop playing to
	improve his hand and start to complete it as quickly as possible, i.e.,
	form sequences and mix suits, in order to win before the other players
	and save himself.</p>

	<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
	<p>3. If his hand has not improved at all or very little since the
	beginning of the game and he has small chance of completing his hand in
	any way before some other player does, his only plan is to hold the
	tiles which he thinks would help the other players and discard only
	those which he is sure they will not pung. These tiles can be
	ascertained by carefully searching the discards in the center of the
	table and the sets already exposed by the other players. By playing this
	way he may be able to cause the game to be a draw.</p>

	<p>There are a few other points which are taken up in the last four layouts
	in Part I.</p>

	<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

	<h2><a name="USE_OF_THE_MANDARINS" id="USE_OF_THE_MANDARINS"></a>USE OF THE MANDARINS</h2>

	<h4>(Flowers and Seasons)</h4>

	<p>The <i>Mandarins</i>, also called <i>Flowers</i> and <i>Seasons</i>, are eight in
	number, two for each of the four winds. They may be eliminated from the
	set and are not usually used in the play, as they add a large element of
	chance into the game.</p>

	<p>If they are used, each side of the wall is increased by two tiles,
	making each side a double tiered row of 18 tiles side by side.</p>

	<p>Then, if a player draws one of his own <i>wind mandarins</i>, he exposes it
	on the table and draws a "loose tile," the <i>mandarin</i> of his own wind
	permitting him to double his score once. If then he draws the other
	<i>mandarin</i> of his own wind he repeats the above process and may double
	his total score again. Where "<i>Seasons</i> and <i>Flowers</i>" are used instead
	of <i>mandarins</i> the numbers on them, 1, 2, 3 and 4, represent <i>East,
	South, West and North winds</i> respectively. The red numbers are the
	"<i>Seasons</i>" and the green numbers are the "<i>Flowers</i>." They are used
	exactly as are the <i>mandarins</i>, i.e., One's own "<i>Season</i>" will double
	the value of his hand, as <i>will</i> his own "<i>Flower</i>." Both of them will
	double the value twice.</p>

	<hr style="width: 65%;" />

	<h2><a name="SCORE_CARD" id="SCORE_CARD"></a>SCORE CARD</h2>

	<p>It will be seen at a glance that the scoring values are divided into
	three parts. First, the bonus scores which only the winner can use;
	secondly, the combination scores which all four players can use; finally
	the doubling honors which all four players may use, so it is that in
	settling the scores the winner starts at the top with twenty (20) points
	for "<i>Mah-Jongg</i>" or for winning and goes down the list scoring ten
	points, if he has no sequence in his hand and so on thru the bonus
	scores, adding to these whatever scores he obtains from combinations in
	his hand or on the table and doubling the sum as many times as he has
	doubling honors.</p>

	<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

	<p>In the bonus scores for the winning hand only there are six items:</p>

	<p>1. "<i>Mah-Jongg</i>" which gives 20 points for winning the hand.</p>

	<p>2. <i>No sequence in hand or on table.</i> This is a bonus of 10 points given
	to a player if he wins without use of sequences.</p>

	<p>3. <i>Drawing the winning piece.</i> This is a bonus of 2 points given to the
	winning player if he <i>draws</i> the tile which completes his hand from the
	wall. Of course <i>punging</i> the winning tile will forfeit this bonus.</p>

	<p>4. <i>Filling the only place to win.</i> This is a bonus of 2 points given
	to a player who fills the only possible place to win, i.e., winning by
	matching the pair or drawing the middle tile of a sequence.</p>

	<p>5. <i>Winning on a draw from a loose tile.</i> This of course is a bonus of
	ten points given to the winning player if any of his loose tile draws
	have been fortunate enough to complete his hand.</p>

	<p>6. <i>No other score than "Mah-Jongg" in hand or on table.</i> This is a
	bonus of ten points given to the winning player having only 20 points
	for "<i>Mah-Jongg</i>" as his score, and is a hand made up of four sequences
	and a pair in which there is no score, a sequence having no scoring
	value whatsoever. Of course even drawing the winning piece will forfeit
	this bonus as can easily be seen.</p>

	<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

	<p>In the combination scores exposed sets are those on the table; face up
	to the right of the player, concealed sets are those which are in his
	hand at the time of winning. As will be seen by the score card,
	concealed sets having been made up by the player without the assistance
	of a pung or chow score twice as much as the same set would if it were
	on the table. This together with the fact that sets of ones, nines,
	winds or dragons score twice as much as sets of twos, threes, fours,
	fives, sixes, sevens and eights should be helpful in memorizing the
	score which is essential to the careful playing of each hand.</p>

	<p>As for the doubling honors, each set or combination doubles the total
	score once, and if there are five <i>doubling honors</i> in a hand, the total
	score should be doubled five times&mdash;for example: a player goes
	<i>Mah-Jongg</i> or <i>Mah-Diao</i> having 32 points in bonus scores, 18 in
	combination scores, making his total score 50. Then if he has five
	<i>doubling honors</i> his final score is 1,600 points, i.e.,
	50-100-200-400-800-1,600.</p>

	sequences. 2. He did not draw the winning piece. 3. He did not fill the
	only place to win. 4. He has other score than <i>Mah-Jongg</i>. 5. He did not
	win on a loose tile draw. In combination value, he has only two points
	for the set of three 2 dots, the sets of sequences helping complete the
	hand, but scoring nothing. There are no doubling honors in the hand so
	the final score is 22. This is the lowest winning hand that can be
	scored.</p>

	<p >East wind collects this amount from each of the other three players,
	making a total of 132,096 points that East may win in one hand. This is
	the highest hand which is probable. There is a hand composed of sets of
	3 of a kind, similar to this, which, if drawn on the original draw, will
	yield more points than this, but it is highly improbable that the hand
	will ever actually be drawn by any given player.</p>

	<p>In the four layouts following, the illustrations represent all the hands
	together as they are laid down after one of the players wins. They serve
	to clear up "settling" of the scores and also bring out important points
	in the playing of the hands. In each case the score of the four players
	is given in total and practice in the calculating of scores can be

	<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>
	<p>East Wind "Mah-Jongged" with a total score of <a name="errata7" id="errata7"><ins class = "errata" title = "East Wind scores 480 instead of 608; West Wind scores 272 instead of 400.">608</ins></a> points. He collects
	double this amount from each of the other three winds because he is East
	Wind, and winning, collects double. This makes 1216 from each player or
	a total of 3648. He then throws his hand into the discard and the other
	three players settle, the high hand collecting the difference between
	his hand and the remaining two. In the illustration, West Wind is the
	high hand and he collects 336 from South Wind and 484 from North Wind,
	the difference between his hand and those of South and North Winds,
	respectively. He then discards his hand and leaves the South and North
	Winds to settle. They do this by South Wind collecting 48 points from
	North; both discard their tiles, and the scores are settled. It might be
	best here to analyze the above layout to see how the play went. East
	Wind's hand appeared harmless enough because he had most of it
	concealed, only exposing two sets. On this account, none of the other
	opponents would hesitate about discarding the <a name="errata9" id="errata9"><ins class = "errata" title = "'eight of bamboo' should read 'eight of character.'">eight of bamboo</ins></a> which
	allowed him to Mah-Jongg. North and South Winds having poor hands
	themselves might have held the <ins class = "errata" title = "'eight of bamboo' should read 'eight of character.'">eight of bamboo</ins> and not have taken a
	chance on it "putting him out" if they had been warned how near he was
	to winning, for West Wind had an exceptionally fine hand with the best
	part of it concealed and he won back from North and South Winds more
	than half of his payment to East, the winner.</p>

	<p>North and South Winds fell in a conflict of suits, one of the most
	frequent occurrences of the game and one which spoils a great many
	otherwise good hands. They were both attempting to complete "all dot"
	hands and each has two conflicting pairs, namely, 5 and 6 of dots.
	Either of them to win can only have one pair in their hand, and each was
	holding the other from any chance of winning.</p>

	<p>When two players play for the same suit, it is best for both to give up
	any idea of obtaining all of one suit, and fill in the hand with one or
	two sets of winds or dragons. Very often one can get three doubles in
	this way when it would be impossible to complete a hand of all one suit.</p>

	<p>NORTH WIND MAH-JONGGS</p>

	<p>North Wind Mah-Jonggs with 22 points as his total score. He collects 22
	points apiece from <ins class='mycorr' title="Should read 'West'?"><a name="corr10" id="corr10">North</a></ins> Wind and South Wind. East, however, must pay
	him double or 44, being banker and losing. This gives North Wind a total
	of 88. The other three then settle. West Wind with a total of <a name="errata10" id="errata10"><ins class = "errata" title = "West Wind scores 2562 instead of 2816">2816</ins></a>;
	collects the difference between his hand and East Wind's which is 2814,
	doubled because he won from East Wind and East Wind must pay double when
	he loses. This gives West Wind 5628 from East Wind, and just the
	difference in their hands from South Wind which is 2808. Then South Wind
	in settling with East Wind collects the difference, 4, double or 8. This
	layout demonstrates the point that it is not always necessary to
	Mah-Jongg or win, in order to take in the highest number of points.
	North Wind "Mah-Jongged" and collected only 88 points, whereas West Wind
	collected a total of 8,436 points. What evidently took place in this
	hand goes as follows: West Wind was exceptionally fortunate in the draw
	and soon had three sets of winds and dragons exposed, or on the table.
	The other three players seeing in this a dangerous hand, "ran for
	cover," this consisting of gathering all the sequences possible
	together, and mixing the suits. By doing this a player can very quickly
	complete his hand and win, although his score will be low when he does
	win. However, the one who does "Mah-Jongg," no matter how low his score
	may be, collects that amount, and escapes any exceptionally high scoring
	hands which the other players may hold. In this case it was North Wind
	who won out and avoided paying many points to West Wind by doing so.</p>

	<p>NORTH WIND MAH-JONGGS</p>

	<p>In the above layout, North Wind winning, scores 416; West Wind 64;
	South Wind 10, and East Wind 56; North Wind then takes 832 from East
	Wind, and 416 from West and South Winds. West Wind collects 54 from
	South Wind and 16 from East Wind; East Wind then collects 46 doubled or
	92 from South Wind.</p>

	<p>In this game both North and West Winds played for all dot hands; North
	Wind foreseeing this early in the game filled in his hand with winds and
	dragons, in this way winning out over West Wind; East Wind starting with
	a pair of green dragons kept them until he had all characters except the
	pair. Then came the time for him to decide on whether he would discard
	the pair and try to fill an all character hand, or use the dragons. He
	decided on the latter because looking at North Wind's exposed tiles he
	saw that North Wind was dangerously near to winning. He filled his
	dragons and attempted to win as quickly as possible, almost succeeding
	and needing only one tile to complete his hand.</p>

	<p>NORTH WIND MAH-JONGGS</p>

	<p>North Wind "Mah-Jongged," collects <a name="errata12" id="errata12"><ins class = "errata" title = "Read '368' instead of '304,' and '184' instead of '152.'">304 from East and 152</ins></a> from West and
	South respectively. Then&mdash;East Wind collects 16 doubled or 32 from West
	and 32 doubled or 64 from South. West Wind wins 16 from South who is the
	loser all around. East Wind's difficulty above was that he decided on
	all bamboo hand at the start of the game without having a sufficient
	number of pairs in that suit. The result was that by the time that he
	<i>drew</i> the pairs and was ready to pung discards the other players had
	already discarded a number of tiles which he needed in his hand. They
	were then dead. The result of all this can be seen in his hand above; he
	has still two pairs and a sequence to fill and the particular tiles
	needed to do this (the 4, 5 and 8 of bamboo) have probably all been
	discarded early in the game by the other players. The point thus
	illustrated being: It is not advisable to attempt the completing of a
	suit which all the other players are discarding unless sufficient pairs
	are held from the start to withstand their attacks.</p>

	<h2><a name="PLAYING_WITH_A_LIMIT" id="PLAYING_WITH_A_LIMIT"></a>PLAYING WITH A LIMIT</h2>


	<p>Pung-Chow, as it has been described in the foregoing pages, represents
	the game as it is played with unlimited hands, that is where no limits
	are set on the number of points permissible in the score of a hand. It
	is impractical, however, to play with unlimited hands in a game where a
	stake has been set due to the inconsistencies of the winning hand
	scores; one <i>may</i> win with a hand of 200,000 points, whereas the
	ordinary or average winning hand numbers approximately only 500 to
	1,000.</p>

	<p>On this account the Chinese use a lower scoring system and set limits on
	the hands whenever placing stakes on the game, with a view of limiting
	losses between all players.</p>

	<p>This setting of a limit changes the game considerably, for while the
	procedure of the play is similar to that of the unlimited hand, the
	scoring is almost totally different and the actual playing of the hand
	is changed.</p>

	<p>A player in a limited hand gains nothing by completing a hand scoring
	high in the thousands when held down to the limit which is comparatively
	low. This changes entirely the playing of hands, making each player's
	object no longer to score as high a hand as possible and win, but to
	score as closely to the limit as possible and win, which in practice
	amounts to completing the hand as quickly as possible, mixing sequences
	and sets of all suits and taking all good scoring sets as they come,
	planning for none.</p>

	<p>It can be seen that there is a larger element of fortune or "luck" in
	this method of playing than there is in playing the unlimited hand,
	though in either case the best player will win consistently.</p>

	<h2><a name="THE_PROCEDURE_OF_PLAY" id="THE_PROCEDURE_OF_PLAY"></a>THE PROCEDURE OF PLAY</h2>

	<p class="figcenter"><br /><img  src="images/page57_winds.jpg" alt="Indicators; Wind Box" /><br /></p>

	<p>In playing this sort of a game the wind indicators in their container,
	the Cheung Huen or wind box, are always used, and their use changes the
	method of commencing the game.</p>

	<p>To start the game when using the wind markers the seats are
	preliminarily chosen and any one of the four players throws the two dice
	once, the result of this throw deciding which player is to throw again
	for playing position. Counting of players being done in a
	counter-clockwise direction as previously explained.</p>

	<p>The players thus designated will shuffle the wind indicators thoroughly
	face downward and places any one of them still face downward on top of
	wind box. He then arranges the whole lot in a perpendicular straight
	line in front of them all face downward, placing the box with the wind
	indicator still on top of it in any order he pleases. (See Illustration
	No. 1.)</p>

	<p class="figcenter"><br /><img  src="images/no1.jpg" alt="Illustration No. 1" /><br />
	<span class="caption">Illustration No. 1</span><br /></p>

	<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>
	<p>In this illustration, C first threw the dice; the number was seven,
	deciding A as the player who was to throw again for playing position or
	seat. A has shuffled the markers and arranged them perpendicularly in
	front of him, placing the wind box in second position. He had the
	privilege of placing it in 1st, 3rd or 4th position if he had chosen. He
	then throws with the dice, an 8; this designates D as the player to take
	the first indicator; A the second (also the wind box), B the third, and
	C the fourth.</p>

	<p>He then throws the two dice and the number thrown will decide which
	player is to pick up the indicator farthest from him (or the first
	indicator in the accompanying illustration) counting in the usual manner
	one player at a time in counter-clockwise direction, starting with
	himself as 1. The player indicated will pick up the first indicator, the
	player on his right the second indicator, the player opposite the third
	and the player to his left the east.</p>

	<p>The wind box goes to the player picking up the indicator on top of it
	who then places it in front of him to mark the seat of East Wind. The
	players then look at their indicators; the one drawing the East Wind
	indicator becomes East Wind, and occupies the seat marked by the wind
	box. The remaining three players seat themselves about the table
	according to their draw or wind marker, i.e., draw of West Wind
	indicator opposite to East, North Wind to the left and South Wind to the
	right of him (East).</p>

	<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

	<p>East Wind now takes charge of the wind box and the four indicators which
	are placed in the wind box face up with East Wind on top. The East Wind
	player retains the box until he loses a hand. When this occurs the box
	goes to the right to the player who was South, but now becomes East
	Wind. The East Wind indicator, however, still remaining on top as this
	designates that the East Wind round is being played. The East Wind round
	is over as soon as the fourth player to be East Wind in turn loses. He
	is the one to take charge of the East Wind indicator and placing the
	South Wind indicator on top to indicate the South Wind round, hands the
	box to the original East Wind who now becomes the first East Wind of the
	South Wind round. It will now be seen that four games make up a round
	and four rounds make up a set. In every case the new wind-round must
	commence from the original East Wind player and the box is for the
	purpose of indicating which round of the wind is being played and who is
	the East Wind in that particular hand.</p>

	<p>It should be decided before starting how many sets are to be played.
	Chinese players generally play from 4 to 8 sets in an evening.</p>

	<p>The seats having been chosen and winds positioned, the procedure of play
	continues exactly as has been described before. The wall is broken and
	the tiles drawn in the same manner, "Chowing," "Punging" and filling
	four of a kind are processes gone about in the same manner as they are
	in the other type of game.</p>

	<p>Mah-Jongg also is attained in the same way, i.e., completing four sets
	and a pair.</p>

	<p>Almost the entire difference in the two ways of playing the game is
	found in the scoring.</p>
	<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>
	<p>In the scoring many new combinations have been added, scoring values
	have been changed, and special bonuses, limit hands and new doubling
	honors have been introduced which must now be taken, one at a time, and
	explained in detail. The most important change is that <i>the last 14
	tiles in the wall are never drawn and the game</i> ends and is a draw if it
	reaches this point without conclusion.</p>

	<p>Loose tiles may be drawn of course during the play, but even a loose
	tile cannot be drawn if there are only 14 tiles left in the wall
	including the loose tiles. These last 14 tiles are usually separated a
	little from the rest of the wall to indicate the end.</p>

	<h3 class="smcap left">The Limit Hand.</h3>

	<p>To keep the hands down to a reasonable amount when players are playing
	for stakes, the system of setting a limit as to the number of points
	that can be scored in a hand. This is usually 300 points; in games
	giving a bonus of 10 points for Mah-Jongg, and 400 in games giving a
	bonus of 20 points for Mah-Jongg. East Wind of course is liable for
	double the limit and at the same time may win as high as double the
	limit from each player. To non-winners settling their scores, settle the
	difference in the score up to the limit if neither is East Wind, and up
	to double the limit if either is East Wind.</p>

	<p>The limit is of course entirely optional, and may be set by the players
	at the beginning of the play. A limit of 600 points between players

	<h3 class="smcap left">Washing the Tiles.</h3>

	<p>It is necessary before going into "Washing the Tiles" to explain the
	meaning of "Heads." A Head is a one, nine, wind or a dragon, and a hand
	containing 9 or more different "Heads" on the original hand drawn from
	the wall entitles the player to "Wash Tiles." He calls out "no play" and
	exposes his hand, collecting according to the following table:</p>

	<p>From each player</p>
	<table summary="" id="table27">
	<tr><td class="left-in">&nbsp;&nbsp;9 Heads</td><td class="right">50 points</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="left-in">10 Heads</td><td class="right">70 points</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="left-in">11 Heads</td><td class="right">100 points</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="left-in">12 Heads</td><td class="right">150 points</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="left-in">13 Heads</td><td class="right">200 points</td></tr>
	</table>

	<p>When washing the tiles takes place, the tiles must be reshuffled and the
	wall built over. East Wind retains the "Cheung" (wind box) and not
	collecting double when he "washes tiles" does not have to pay any of the
	other players double when they "wash tiles." It must be remembered that
	in order to wash the tiles the heads must be different, that the hand
	must be the original 13 tiles (14 in case of East Wind) and no drawing
	is permitted.</p>

	<h2><a name="BONUS_SCORES" id="BONUS_SCORES"></a>BONUS SCORES</h2>


	<p>1. For Mah-Jongg or completing a hand a bonus is given and this is
	generally 10 points unless specially agreed upon to be so.</p>

	<p>2. For winning hand of absolutely no scoring value than Mah-Jongg, 10
	points is given as a bonus.</p>

	<p>3. For winning tile drawn by the player himself from the last tile which
	may be drawn in the wall doubles the total score once (i.e., the 15th
	tile from the end of the wall).</p>

	<p>4. Winning on a draw from a loose tile doubles total score once.</p>

	<p>5. To win on first card played a bonus of half the limit hand is given.
	Washing cards have preference over this <ins class='mycorr' title="Should read
        'hand' or 'win'?"><a name="corr11" id="corr11">wind.</a></ins></p>

	<p>6. For completing the hand with the fourth card of an exposed set of
	three of a kind&mdash;for example, if a player has an exposed set of 3 of a
	kind and he draws or pungs the fourth tile, and if this very tile is the
	winning tile, he may double the total score once.</p>

	<h2><a name="LIMIT_HANDS" id="LIMIT_HANDS"></a>LIMIT HANDS</h2>


	<p>A player holding a winning hand of any one of the following combinations
	receives from each of the players the full amount agreed upon.</p>

	<p>1. A winning hand of single heads one only of each with a pair of heads
	different from the rest representing the final pair.</p>
	<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
		<p class="figcenter"><br /><img  src="images/no2.jpg" alt="Illustration No. 2" /><br />
	<span class="caption">Illustration No. 2</span><br /></p>


	<p>2. A winning hand containing <i>sets</i> of heads <i>only</i> with a pair of
	<i>heads</i> as the final pair.</p>

	<p class="figcenter"><br /><img  src="images/no3.jpg" alt="Illustration No. 3" /><br />
	<span class="caption">Illustration No. 3</span><br /></p>

	<p>3. A winning hand of four different sets of winds and any kind of a
	final pair. In China this hand is called the four happinesses and
	superstition has it that one holding this hand has much good fortune
	coming to him having the four happinesses at his door.</p>

	<p class="figcenter"><br /><img  src="images/no4.jpg" alt="Illustration No. 4" /><br />
	<span class="caption">Illustration No. 4</span><br /></p>

	<p>4. The winning hand of 3 different sets of winds with a pair of the
	other winds as the final pair.</p>

	<p class="figcenter"><br /><img  src="images/no5.jpg" alt="Illustration No. 5" /><br />
	<span class="caption">Illustration No. 5</span><br /></p>
	<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

	<p>5. A winning hand made up entirely of sets of four of a kind with any
	pair as the final pair.</p>

	<p class="figcenter"><br /><img  src="images/no6.jpg" alt="Illustration No. 6" /><br />
	<span class="caption">Illustration No. 6</span><br /></p>

	<p>6. East Wind winning on original draw from the wall. This
	<ins class='mycorr' title="Should read 'hand' or 'win'?"><a name="corr5" id="corr5">wind</a></ins>
	has preference over washing cards. The Chinese consider this hand as a
	forecast of misfortunes to come.</p>

	<p>7. A winning hand containing the 3 sets of dragons; red, green and
	white. In China these are known as the 3 Doctors of Literature. The
	inference of course being that many tiles must be turned away before
	these three sets can be made up just as many students in China are
	turned away by competitive examinations before the three best scholars
	are chosen to pursue their studies at the Royal Court with the title of
	Doctors of Literature.</p>

	<p>1. Pair of 2-8 punged to complete hand. A player must have four sets and
	a pair to win. The above scoring value is given if the pair is from 2 to
	8 and if he pungs one of them to win.</p>

	<p>2. Pair of 2-8 drawn to complete hand. This score is given as above when
	the player's extra pair is from 2-8, but he must match the pair by draw.</p>

	<p>3. Pair of heads punged to complete hand. This four points is given when
	player pungs to match his final pair.</p>

	<p>4. Pair of heads drawn to complete hand. This six points is given when
	player draws and matches his final pair.</p>

	<p>5. Pair of player's own wind punged by him in his own wind round to
	complete his hand. This six points is given to a player who "pungs" to
	match this final pair when his final pair is his own wind and it is his
	own wind round.</p>

	<p>6. Pair of the player's own wind in his own wind round drawn by him to
	complete his hand. This is similar to the one above except that the
	player draws the tile instead of punging it, thereby getting 8 points
	instead of 6 points.</p>

	<p>7. Filling a sequence in the middle or on the only open end to complete
	hand. An example would be chowing a 6 character, have a 5 character and
	a 7 character, or have <ins class='mycorr' title="Should read 'the 1 and 2.'">

	<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>
	<p>Filling a sequence with both ends open, by draw to complete hand. An
	example would be, having a 7 and 8 of character and drawing a 6 or a 9.
	In both this and the above case when the sequence is filled by draw, it
	must immediately be set out face up on the table to the right of player,
	with the draw tile drawn on top of the other two according to the
	illustration.</p>

	discarding, <i>unless the discarder himself had two complete doubling
	honors and was waiting for the winning tile</i> or <i>was waiting for the
	winning tile which would give him more than two doubling honors</i>.</p>

	<p>1. When nine tiles or more of the same suit are exposed and the
	discarded tile gives a winning hand on entirely one suit.</p>

	<p>2. When nine heads or more are exposed and the discarded tile gives a
	winning hand of entirely heads.</p>

	<p>3. When two sets of dragons are exposed and the discard of the other
	kind of dragon gives the third set of dragon in a winning hand.</p>

	<p>4. When three different sets of winds are exposed and the discard of the

	<h2><a name="TWO_AND_THREE-HANDED_GAMES" id="TWO_AND_THREE-HANDED_GAMES"></a>TWO AND THREE-HANDED GAMES</h2>


	<p>Three or even two may play Pung Chow, though the game is essentially a
	four-handed affair. It is played by two or three people in exactly the
	same way that it is played by four, each player building up his own side
	of the wall and then combining to build the fourth side.</p>

	<p>This fourth side is regarded as the dummy wall. In the building and
	breaking down of the wall, East Wind acts for the dummy, throwing the
	dice for it whenever indicated. The three players then draw their
	original hand and ignore the dummy the rest of the game, playing in
	regular routine and omitting the dummy's turn of play.</p>


	<p>When two play alone, each builds two sides of the wall and arrange the
	usual wall. Then they throw the dice, East Wind throwing for either of
	the two dummies, both draw their original hands and draw and discard
	alternately until one wins.</p>

	<p>Of course when two or three play there is less opposition or conflict
	and far greater possibilities in the draw than in the four-handed game.
	On this account, higher scores are the rule rather than the exception,
	making a more exciting and entertaining game but hardly one upon which
	stakes could be safely set.</p>

			<p>The game which is rapidly replacing bridge and other card games, as well

			<p>Pung Chow is an American product differing from the imported sets only
			in the following points:</p>

			<p>It is more pleasing to the eye and the touch.</p>

			<p>The beautiful Oriental colors are fast and cannot rub off, even though
			the pieces be scrubbed with soap and water.</p>

			<p>The pieces will not become sticky from the moisture of the hand.</p>

			<p>Pung Chow pieces are not affected by the climate and will never work
			loose.</p>

			<p>Should one or more pieces be lost they may be easily and quickly
			replaced.</p>

			<p>Pung Chow is an article of beauty and quality and is practically
			indestructible.</p>

	<h2><a name="Transcribers_Notes" id="Transcribers_Notes"></a>Transcriber's Notes</h2>

	<p>The Errata page above is transcribed from the original text. As it is not possible to correct
	some of these errors without also altering subsequent entries in the scoring
	examples, none of the
	errors have been corrected in this version of the book.</p>

	<p>Punctuation and capitalization have been normalized, and the following obvious typographical errors
	in the original text have been corrected:</p>

	<p><a href="#corr1">Page 13</a>. "South Wind, and the the left of" changed to "South Wind,
	and the left of."</p>

	<p><a href="#corr2">Page 15</a>. "if 14 in the sum" changed to "if 14 is the sum."</p>

	<p><a href="#corr7">Page 41</a>. The phrase "Double 3 times for all suit (honor)" changed to "Double 3
	times for all one suit (honor)"</p>

	<p><a href="#corr3">Page 70</a>. "If he discard the winning" changed to "if he discards the winning."</p>

	<p><a href="#corr4">Page 72</a>. "For bo sequences double once" changed to "For no sequences
	double once."</p>

	<p>Additionally it is noted that:</p>

	<p><a href="#corr10">Page 50</a>. The phrase "22 points apiece from North" should likely read "22 points apiece from West."</p>

	<p><a href="#corr11">Page 62</a>. The phrase "Washing cards have preference over this wind"
	should possibly read either "Washing cards ... this hand" or "Washing cards ... this win."</p>

	<p><a href="#corr5">Page 64</a>. The phrase "this wind has preference"
	should possibly read either "this hand has preference," or "this
	win has preference."</p>

	<p><a href="#corr6">Page 66</a>. The phrase "the 2 and chowing the 3"
	should likely read "the 1 and 2 and chowing the 3."</p>

	<p><a href="#corr8">Page 72</a>. The phrase "Players collect 768 from"
	should likely read "Player collects 768 from."</p>

	<p><a href="#corr9">Page 74</a>. The phrase "Players collect 272 from" should likely read "Player collects 272 from."</p>

	<p>There are a number of inconsistencies between the Chapter Headings and the
	Table of Contents.  These have not been corrected. </p>
	<p>In Part II, the numbering of illustrations is non-continuous: there is no
	Illustration No. 7 in the original. </p>
